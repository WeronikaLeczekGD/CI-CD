# CI-CD

1. What is needed to implement continuous integration and what benefits does it bring?

it is in build process. It is about constantlly pushing a code to github(example).

benefits- " no merge hell", keeps developers productive, it gives us a constantly testable build
   
2. What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
They are vey similar. Continuous delivery is just a little bit more cautious than deployment.
*Continuous delivery means that you had deploying often using automation but it may involve a manual step for example when you will need to approve a deployment. Despite this manual step, deployment itself is still automated and can be repeated, also is safe to do.
*Continuous Deployment is full automation, every code change is deployed all the way to production. It means there's no manual intervention of approvals

3. What role does test automation play in continuous delivery?
continous delivery-"how do I quickly get code into production"
In continous delivery we use technology like Jenkins CD to automate deployment 

4. What is GitOps and how it is related to CI/CD?


5. Which open-source tools are frequently used for CI/CD automation?
